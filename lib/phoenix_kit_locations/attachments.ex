defmodule PhoenixKitLocations.Attachments do
  @moduledoc """
  Folder-scoped file attachments + featured image for Locations
  resources (Location, Space). Designed for **multi-resource** LVs:
  many Files cards can live on the same page, each keyed by an
  opaque string "scope" — typically the resource's id or a draft id.

  This is a re-shape of the single-resource Attachments pattern in
  `PhoenixKitCatalogue.Attachments`. Catalogue's version stores
  everything in top-level socket assigns (`:files_folder_uuid`,
  `:featured_image_uuid`, …), which forces one resource per LV.
  Here, all that state lives in a per-scope map:

      socket.assigns.attachments_by_scope = %{
        "location" => %{folder_uuid: …, featured_image_uuid: …, files: […], …},
        "floor-uuid-1" => %{…},
        "new-uuid-XYZ" => %{…}
      }

  Modal state (`:show_media_selector` and friends) stays shared at
  the socket level — only one modal opens at a time — but tracks
  `:media_selector_scope` so the picker's result applies to the
  right resource.

  Uploads use a single shared config (`@upload_name`). The dropzone
  in each Files card calls `set_active_upload_scope/2` on click so
  `handle_progress/3` knows which scope's folder the file belongs to.
  Edge case: clicking dropzone A then dropzone B before either file
  picker resolves will route the next-picked file to B — accepted
  trade for keeping one upload config instead of N atom-named refs.

  ## Usage

      # Mount
      socket
      |> Attachments.mount(scope: "location", resource: location)
      |> Attachments.mount(scope: "floor-1", resource: floor)
      |> Attachments.allow_attachment_upload()

      # Render — pass scope to each Files card render
      <FilesCard scope="location" state={Attachments.state(@socket, "location")} … />
      <FilesCard scope="floor-1"  state={Attachments.state(@socket, "floor-1")}  … />

      # Events take scope via phx-value
      def handle_event("open_featured_image_picker", %{"scope" => scope}, s),
        do: Attachments.open_featured_image_picker(s, scope)

      def handle_event("set_active_upload_scope", %{"scope" => scope}, s),
        do: {:noreply, Attachments.set_active_upload_scope(s, scope)}

      # Save-time — inject for each scope
      params = Attachments.inject_attachment_data(params, socket, "location")

      # After a `:new` resource is persisted, rename its pending folder
      :ok = Attachments.maybe_rename_pending_folder_for(folder_uuid, saved_resource)

  ## Resource shape

  Each scope's resource carries a `data` JSONB with
  `files_folder_uuid` and `featured_image_uuid` keys. Add a clause
  to `folder_name_for/1` to support additional resource structs.

  ## Parent folder

  By default resource folders are created at the storage root. A host can
  group them under per-type containers:

      config :phoenix_kit_locations, :attachments_parent_folder, {MyApp.Media, :for_location}

  Called as `for_location(:location | :space, actor_uuid, resource)`
  (3-arity, receiving the resource struct itself) when exported, else as
  `for_location(kind, actor_uuid)` (2-arity, the original contract). Either
  arity returns `{:ok, parent_folder_uuid}` or `nil` (root).

  ## Host-named folders

  A host that wants people-facing folder names (following the resource's
  own name, not `location-<uuid>` / `location-space-<uuid>`) configures:

      config :phoenix_kit_locations, :attachments_folder_name, {MyApp.Media, :name_for}

  called as `name_for(resource, actor_uuid) :: {:ok, name} | nil` — `nil`
  (e.g. for an unsaved resource) falls back to the deterministic name.
  `find_resource_folder/2` looks a resource's folder up in that order: the
  host name under the resolved parent, then the deterministic name under
  the parent, then the deterministic name at the root — so a folder the
  host has renamed is still found without a stored pointer, and folders
  that predate the setting are still found. `maybe_rename_pending_folder_for/2`
  writes both the host name and the parent, so a resource created before
  either hook was configured is moved into place once it is.
