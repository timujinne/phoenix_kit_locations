defmodule PhoenixKitLocations.MediaReorganizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Locations' media-reorganizer plan source.

  Implements core's `PhoenixKit.Modules.Storage.Reorganizer.Source` contract
  (`plan(actor_uuid, opts) :: [map()]`, shipped in core 2.24.0) without
  declaring `@behaviour`: the `:phoenix_kit` requirement stays `~> 2.0`, and
  on an older core the behaviour module does not exist. Core finds this
  module through `PhoenixKitLocations.media_reorganizer/0` by name and
  validates each map with `Reorganizer.Action.new!/1`, so the plain maps are
  the whole contract. Add `@behaviour`/`@impl` once the core floor is raised
  to 2.24.

  Contract (design §9/§10 of `2026-09-15-media-reorganizer-design.md`):

    * **No configured `:attachments_parent_folder` hook → `:report`-only.**
      Orphan and pending-folder reports are still produced (informational,
      no writes); no `:move`, no `:trash`, no pointer back-fill happen.
    * **Claims are hook-independent.** Every live record's valid, live
      pointer folder is "claimed" regardless of whether a hook is
      configured — a pending folder any live record points at is never
      trashed, hook or no hook, and a claimed folder is never reported as
      an orphan even when its own name happens to match no record.
    * **A hook that raises, exits, or returns anything but `{:ok, uuid}` or
      an explicit `nil`** is a hook FAILURE: the record is skipped (no
      move planned for it) and counted into one `kind: :hook_error` report
      for the whole plan. Only an explicit `nil` means "root". Every
      `{:ok, uuid}` answer is cast through `Ecto.UUID.cast/1` and
      downcased before use — a non-UUID answer is a failure too, and an
      upper-case answer never looks "different" from the same answer
      lower-cased on the next run. A configured `{mod, fun}` that isn't
      actually callable is reported the same way, once, distinct from "no
      hook configured". The (optional) `:attachments_folder_name` hook is
      held to the same standard — a raising/garbage-returning name hook
      also counts into `:hook_error`, not a silent legacy-name fallback.
    * **An explicit `nil`/`{:ok, nil}` answer never pulls a folder that is
      currently live under a real parent out to root.** For such a
      candidate, `nil` yields only a pointer back-fill (if any); the
      folder's actual parent and name are left untouched and the record is
      counted into one `kind: :hook_nil` report for the whole plan.
    * **Current-folder lookup mirrors `Attachments.find_resource_folder/2`:**
      host-named folder under the resolved parent (unclaimed by another
      record's live pointer), then the legacy deterministic name under the
      resolved parent, then the legacy name at root. A host-named folder
      found live and unclaimed IS the current folder (already-correct
      case — the plan then only needs a pointer back-fill). Host-named and
      legacy-named both live at once, two legacy matches (parent + root),
      or two records both actually resolving to the very same live folder
      are all unresolvable — each is a `kind: :duplicate` report, never a
      `:move`. A host name already claimed (by a *different* record's live
      pointer) can't be adopted either — the desired name falls back to
      the deterministic legacy name instead (D3), same as the retry
      `Attachments.with_name_fallback/3` performs at upload time.
    * **A folder found through a record's live pointer keeps its own name**
      (never renamed) unless that name is still the legacy deterministic
      one — a record whose pointer folder still literally reads
      `location-<uuid>` / `location-space-<uuid>` gets the host name like
      any other candidate.
    * **A legacy-named folder live somewhere other than root or the
      resolved parent** (e.g. an old container from a previous layout) is
      left alone and reported `kind: :relocated` — never adopted or moved.
      Every such stray copy gets its own report, not only the first one,
      unless the copy is itself another record's claimed (adopted or
      pointed-at) folder.
    * **Two records whose resolved *targets* would coincide** (same
      `{parent, desired name}`) are reported `kind: :duplicate` instead of
      both being planned as moves (the second would collide at apply
      time).
    * Only records that already have SOME live folder (a live pointer, or
      a folder anywhere matching the legacy name) are *candidates* — a
      record with neither never triggers a (possibly writing) host hook.
    * **Candidate detection runs against the light select** (uuid/name/
      status/pointer only), but a host hook is opaque — it may read any
      column (Andi's location hook reads `space.location_uuid` and other
      fields the same way a light `Category` select without `parent_uuid`
      once made a catalogue hook plan wrong moves). Every candidate's
      record is swapped for its FULL row — one batched
      `where uuid in ^candidate_uuids` query per kind — before it ever
      reaches `attachments_parent_folder`, `attachments_folder_name`, or
      `after_move`.

  Also covers stale `location-attachment-pending-*` upload folders and
  orphaned legacy folders whose record is gone — see the section comments
  below. Unlike catalogue's records, `Location`/`Space` are hard-deleted
  (`Locations.delete_location/2`, `Spaces.delete_space/2`) — a missing
  record is the only way to be orphaned.

  ## Pointer back-fill

  `Location`/`Space` have no `data_owned_keys`-style scoped update — unlike
  catalogue, `after_move` writes the pointer with a direct, locked
  (`FOR UPDATE`) repo update of the record's own `data` map, never through
  `Locations.update_location/3` / `Spaces.update_space/3` (those run the
  full context path — `Activity.log`, PubSub, full changeset validation —
  none of which belongs inside the engine's per-action transaction, and a
  broadcast for a move that then rolls back would be a lie).
