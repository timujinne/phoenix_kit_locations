# Changelog

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Requires `phoenix_kit >= 2.38.0 and < 3.0.0`. Actor resolution, activity
  logging, space tree queries, resource folders, uploads, file icons/sizes, the
  media reorganizer and the edit-language tabs now run on core's shared
  toolkits instead of module copies.
- The dropzone hook ships as a prebuilt bundle declared by `js_sources/0`, so a
  host no longer has to import the module's colocated hooks.
- Admin header shapes: "Locations / New location", "Locations / <name> / Edit",
  "Locations / <name> / Structure", "Locations / Types / New type" and
  "Locations / Types / <name> / Edit".
- The location and location-type edit forms open on the viewing language.
- `update_location/3` returns `{:error, :location_not_found}` and
  `update_space/3` returns `{:error, :space_not_found}` for a record deleted
  since the caller loaded it, instead of raising `Ecto.StaleEntryError`.

### Fixed

- Two opposite space re-parents at once could both pass the cycle check and
  commit a loop. A re-parent (a move to the top level included) now holds the
  location's tree lock. The cycle check no longer calls a chain deeper than
  64 levels a cycle.
- A space update carrying another `location_uuid` could move it out of its
  location and strand its children.
- A save could drop or replace a files folder claimed while the form was open.
- The files card's drag-and-drop hook never reached a host that did not
  import colocated hooks.
- An upload that could not be filed stayed in the list at 100% and counted
  against the upload limit.
- A byte-identical re-upload now shows a notice instead of silently adding
  nothing.
- Saving a space or location deleted in another session crashed the page.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- Page titles render in the PhoenixKit admin header instead of an in-page
  header: "Locations" and "Locations / Types" (with the New Location / New
  Type button in the header), "Locations / New" and "Locations / <name>" on
  the location form and Structure page, "Locations / Types / New" or
  "… / <name>" on the type form.
- The "Locations" list subtab is shown only alongside Types (with
  `locations.manage_all`); an owner-scoped user gets a single "Locations"
  sidebar entry instead of "Locations / Locations".

## 0.5.2 - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Media reorganizer source (`media_reorganizer/0` →
  `PhoenixKitLocations.MediaReorganizer`) for core 2.24's
  `mix phoenix_kit.media.reorganize`. It plans moves of existing location and
  space folders under the host's `:attachments_parent_folder` /
  `:attachments_folder_name` hooks, back-fills missing folder pointers, trashes
  stale empty pending upload folders, and reports duplicates, relocated copies,
  orphans and failing hooks. Without a configured parent hook it only reports.

### Fixed

- A folder pointer still carrying a `location-attachment-pending-*` name (a
  failed post-insert rename) is now renamed to the host name instead of keeping
  the pending name forever.
- A record whose name hook fails no longer drops its resolved parent from the
  orphan-folder scan.
- A `"name (1)"` folder is no longer read as a collision suffix of `"name"`;
  the rule now matches core's (`N >= 2`).

## 0.5.1 - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Attachment folders can be created under a host-configured parent
  (`:attachments_parent_folder`); the host can also name them
  (`:attachments_folder_name`). Lookups check the host name under the
  parent, then the deterministic name under the parent, then the root.

### Fixed

- A folder found by its host name is adopted only when no other location or
  space points at it, so a same-named location (possibly another account's)
  never shows or stores another location's files. A host name already taken
  under the parent falls back to the deterministic `location-<uuid>` name.
- The pending-folder rename changes only the name again. It passed no actor,
  so an actor-dependent parent hook moved freshly uploaded files to the
  storage root.
- A raising parent or name hook is logged and treated as `nil` instead of
  crashing the form mid-upload.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-15

⚠️ **Breaking for hosts with custom roles:** the `locations` permission now
covers only the locations a user (or their organization) owns. Grant the new
`locations.manage_all` sub-permission to roles that should manage every
location. Admin receives it automatically at boot; Owner holds every key.
Run `mix phoenix_kit.update` after upgrading: this release ships its own
migrations. Deploy the new version only after that migration has run:
`Location` now reads `owner_uuid`, and every location query fails until the
column exists.

### Added

- **Module-owned migrations** (`PhoenixKitLocations.Migrations`, returned from
  `migration_module/0`; version tracked as a `pkloc_schema:<N>` comment on
  `phoenix_kit_locations`). `mix phoenix_kit.update` discovers the chain and
  generates the host migration.
  - **V1** adopts the four tables core's V135 baseline creates, with identical
    DDL and object names. On existing installs only the version marker is new;
    no core release is required.
  - **V2** adds a nullable `owner_uuid` to `phoenix_kit_locations` (foreign key
    to `phoenix_kit_users`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`) and its index.
  - `down/1` never drops a table.
- **Location ownership.** A location can belong to a person or an organization
  account; without an owner it is global.
  - Set the owner with `create_location(attrs, owner_uuid: uuid)` or change it
    with `set_location_owner/3` (logs `location.owner_changed`). An
    `owner_uuid` inside `attrs` is ignored, so forms can't reassign ownership.
  - `list_locations/1`, `count_locations/1` and `find_similar_addresses/5`
    take an `owner_uuid:` filter: a uuid, a list of uuids, `nil` (global only)
    or `:any` (every owned location). Omitting it keeps returning everything.
  - `get_location_for_owner/2` resolves a location only for its owner(s).
  - Deleting a user deletes the locations they own; `before_user_delete/1` logs
    a `location.deleted` entry for each first.
- **Owner-scoped access** (`PhoenixKitLocations.Policy`, the bookings pattern):
  the same `/admin/locations` pages serve both kinds of user.
  - Base `locations`: list, create, edit, delete and Structure for locations
    owned by the user or by the user's organization.
  - Sub-permission `locations.manage_all`: every location, assigning owners,
    internal notes, attachments and the Types pages.
- **Organization sharing.** A person who belongs to an organization account
  sees and manages its locations, and locations they create belong to the
  organization (`Policy.owner_uuids/1`, `Policy.new_owner_uuid/1`).
- **Admin owner controls:** an Owner column and All / Global / Owned filter on
  the list, and an owner picker on the location form.
- **`PlacePicker` `:owner_uuid` attr** (uuid, list, `nil` or `:any`), enforced
  on selection as well as search.

### Fixed

- The Structure page renamed or deleted a space from a forged event even when
  the space belonged to a different location. Space actions now accept only
  spaces in the loaded location, and every Structure write re-checks access to
  the location first.
- A client-sent `files_folder_uuid` / `featured_image_uuid` in a location's or
  space's `data` could be stored and aim later file actions at another folder.
  Attachment pointers now come only from server-side state.
- A malformed uuid in a Structure page or `PlacePicker` event no longer crashes
  the LiveView.
- `toggle_type` accepts only types the form offered (or that are already
  linked).

## 0.4.2 - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **Details/Structure tab strip uses core `<.nav_tabs variant={:border}>`** (#13).
  The wrapper's local API (`location` + `active` atom) is unchanged; only the
  markup moves to core so the underline look stays in one place. Needs
  `phoenix_kit` 2.13.6 (verbatim `:navigate` + the border variant); the mix.exs
  pin stays `~> 2.0` so later 2.x minors still resolve.

### Fixed

- The edit Location form now shows the Details/Structure tab strip. It was
  only rendered on the Structure page, so there was no in-page way from
  Details to Structure.
- `PhoenixKitLocations.version/0` had drifted to `"0.4.0"` after the 0.4.1
  bump. It now has to match `mix.exs`.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Sidebar tab labels are translated** (#12). All eight admin tabs now declare
  `gettext_backend` and `gettext_domain`. Without them a tab label is passed
  through untranslated no matter what the `.po` files hold, so the Locations
  section stayed English in every locale while its pages were fully translated.

### Changed

- Dependency updates (`phoenix_kit` 2.2.0, `phoenix` 1.8.10, `hackney` 4.7.3).

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **⚠️ Requires `phoenix_kit ~> 2.0`.** The core pin moved to `~> 2.0`, so this
  release no longer resolves against core 1.7.

  Core 2.0.0 squashes the migration chain into a single `V135` baseline and makes
  V135 the chain's floor: `mix ecto.migrate` now *refuses* on a database below it
  rather than migrating. Check `mix phoenix_kit.status` **before** upgrading. A
  host below V135 must install `phoenix_kit 1.7.236` — the migration bridge, the
  last release carrying the full pre-squash chain — migrate until the reported
  version is at least V135, and only then move to 2.0.

  This package does not call migration internals, so the change is the pin
  itself.

### Added

- **Sites tab for the `phoenix_kit_projects` hub (PR #10).** Contributed through
  `phoenix_kit_project_extensions/0`, the duck-typed one-way discovery contract —
  the projects package finds it, and this package takes **no dependency** on
  projects. Linkage is per-project config (comma-separated location UUIDs in the
  Modules & features panel), not a foreign key. Read-only address cards with
  link-outs to the locations admin; a stale UUID or a DB hiccup degrades to a
  missing card rather than crashing the host project page.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Space kinds extended** from `floor/room` to `floor/room/zone/section/aisle/shelf` (app-layer list; the core V122 CHECK constraint already allowed them), with localized labels/icons via the module's own gettext backend (en/et/ru).
- **Structure tab** (`LocationStructureLive`) — an N-deep Space tree UI (`SpaceTree`, modeled on core's `FolderExplorer`) replacing the old two-level staged floor/room draft flow. Immediate-commit CRUD (create/rename/reorder/delete) with activity logging; delete opens a confirmation modal reporting the true descendant count (`Spaces.count_descendants/1`, a recursive CTE) since a hard delete CASCADEs the whole subtree. Each Space gets its own Files + Featured Image card via the existing multi-resource Attachments pattern, and its own multilang name/description.
- **`Spaces.full_path/2`** — locale-aware breadcrumb ("Location / Floor / Zone / Shelf") via a cycle-safe recursive CTE.
- **`PlacePicker`** — a LiveComponent combining a Location search-combobox with the Space tree in read-only picker mode, for consumers (e.g. `phoenix_kit_manufacturing`) that need to pick a Location and optionally a Space in one widget. Sends `{:place_picker_select, id, %{location_uuid, space_uuid}}`.
- Auto-positioning of new spaces (`Spaces.create_space/2` appends to the end of its sibling group when no `position` is given).

### Fixed
- `PlacePicker`'s `select_location` handler unconditionally reset the local `selected_space_uuid` to `nil`, which clobbered a consumer-seeded selection the moment the matching Location was picked — defeating the component's own "seed-once" contract (and its test) for the one case it exists to cover. Now the seed is kept when it's present in the newly-loaded tree.
- `lib/phoenix_kit_locations.ex`'s `version/0` had drifted to `"0.1.1"` (stale since before 0.2.0) while `mix.exs` and the version-compliance test only checked consistency with each other, not against it. All three now agree.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Env-gated local dependency override.** `phoenix_kit` (and future sibling `phoenix_kit_*` deps) now resolve through a `pk_dep/3` helper in `mix.exs`: export `<APP>_PATH` (e.g. `PHOENIX_KIT_PATH=../phoenix_kit`) to build/test against a local checkout via `path:` + `override: true`; unset or blank falls back to the published Hex pin, so `mix hex.publish` and CI resolve exactly as before. Documented in `AGENTS.md`. A blank/whitespace value is treated as unset (`System.get_env/1` returns `""`, not `nil`), so `PHOENIX_KIT_PATH= mix test` no longer produces a broken `path: ""` dep.

### Changed
- Dependency lockfile refreshed (incl. `phoenix_kit` 1.7.125 → 1.7.133); the `~> 1.7.125` requirement is unchanged and the published runtime/API is identical to 0.2.0.
- Minor docstring cleanup in `PhoenixKitLocations.Locations.log_module_toggle/2`.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Spaces** — nested floors and rooms under a Location (`PhoenixKitLocations.Spaces` + `Schemas.Space`, backed by core migration V122 `phoenix_kit_location_spaces`). Edited as staged in-memory drafts that commit on the global Location save; floors are top-level tabs, rooms nest under the active floor. Block-on-invalid validation gate with a kind-aware flash that names the offending draft ("Floor 2 needs a name" / "Room 1 in Floor 2 needs a name"). Floor delete cascades to its rooms; partial-save failures keep the failed drafts on the page. Context guards the same-Location parent invariant and indirect-cycle prevention (depth-bounded walk-up).
- **Attachments** — scope-aware Files cards + featured-image picker per Location and per Space draft (`PhoenixKitLocations.Attachments`), routing drag-and-drop uploads to the right scope.
- Per-draft independent language selector on floor and room editors.
- `PhoenixKitLocations.Errors` atoms for Spaces: `:space_not_found`, `:parent_in_other_location`, `:parent_not_found`, `:cycle`, `:parent_floor_unsaved`.

### Changed
- **Dependency floor raised: `{:phoenix_kit, "~> 1.7.105"}` → `"~> 1.7.125"`.** 1.7.125 is the first core release shipping migration V122; the Spaces feature would have no table on older cores.
- Locations/Types in-page tab nav removed in favor of the PhoenixKit admin dashboard's sibling subtabs; replaced with `<.admin_page_header>`. Name cells in both tables now navigate to the edit page on click.
- Full-width admin layout across all three LiveViews (forms capped at an inner `max-w`); dropped the deprecated `back=` attr from headers.

### Fixed
- Saving a Location with no staged spaces no longer crashes the form — `persist_space_drafts/3` had a dead `[] -> nil` clause shadowing the `{nil, MapSet.new()}` clause, so the empty-drafts path raised a `MatchError` on the (common) spaceless save.
- `Spaces.reorder_siblings/4` no longer silently no-ops for root-level floors — a pinned `parent_uuid == ^nil` compiled to SQL `= NULL` (zero rows); the `nil`-parent case now uses `is_nil/1`.
- `Spaces.update_space/3`'s cycle check now reads `parent_uuid` under both string and atom keys (via a shared `fetch_attr/2`), matching the parent-location check — an atom-keyed `attrs` map no longer bypasses the guard.
- `check_parent_under_location/2` returns the accurate `:parent_not_found` when a parent UUID doesn't exist, instead of conflating it with `:parent_in_other_location`.

### Quality
- `mix precommit` clean: `compile --force --warnings-as-errors`, `deps.unlock --check-unused`, `format --check-formatted`, `credo --strict`, `dialyzer` all pass. Restored `handle_event/3` and `persist_room/5` clause grouping that the Spaces work had split (which `--warnings-as-errors` rejected).
- Pure-helper test suites for `Space` schema, `Attachments` helpers, and the new `Errors` atoms.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- `check_address` no longer crashes the location form's LiveView on address-field blur. `phx-blur` delivers `%{"key", "value"}`, not the form's serialized params, so the old `%{"location" => params}` clause never matched and every blur raised `FunctionClauseError` — taking down the LiveView, forcing a reconnect, and wiping every in-progress field. The handler now reads the address from the changeset (kept current by `phx-change="validate"`).

### Quality
- `check_address` tests now drive the real `phx-blur` event via `render_blur` on the input element instead of a hand-crafted `render_hook` payload, plus a regression test asserting the LiveView survives a blur and preserves typed fields.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `PhoenixKitLocations.Errors` module — central gettext-backed mapping from error atoms to user-facing strings.
- Activity logging across all mutations (location + type create/update/delete, `sync_location_types`, `add_location_type`, `remove_location_type`, module enable/disable). Metadata is PII-audited at the source.
- `LocationTypeAssignment.changeset/2` with `assoc_constraint/2` — FK violations now surface as `{:error, changeset}` instead of `Ecto.ConstraintError`.
- `@spec` typespecs on every public Locations API; `@type t` on each schema.
- Test infrastructure: `Test.Endpoint`, `Test.Router`, `LiveCase`, scope-injection `on_mount` hook, destructive-rescue test file.
- README sections for Error Handling and Activity Logging.

### Changed
- `sync_location_types/3` short-circuits to `{:ok, :unchanged}` when the requested type set matches existing assignments — no DB write, no activity log spam.
- `get_location_by/2` allowlists `:name` / `:email` / `:phone`; arbitrary caller-chosen atoms are rejected.
- All admin LiveView forms now use core `<.input>` / `<.select>` / `<.textarea>` primitives; dropped homegrown error helpers.
- `phx-disable-with` on every submit button to prevent double-submit.
- Replaced inline section-header SVGs with `<.icon name="hero-...">` from core.

### Fixed
- Save-error paths now `Map.put(changeset, :action, :validate)` so validation errors render via core `<.input>` (which gates on `changeset.action != nil`).
- Feature-flag labels are now extractable by `mix gettext.extract` via a literal-call helper.

### Quality
- 188 tests, 0 failures (up from 73).
- 96.89% line coverage via `mix test --cover`.
- `mix precommit` clean (compile + format + credo --strict + dialyzer).
